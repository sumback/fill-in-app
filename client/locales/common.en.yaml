    rules: Principle of the game
    block1:
      title: The principle of fill-in is very simple
      detail1: Each player receives 12 response cards to start.
      detail2: A first player (the "Question Master") reads a question card.
      detail3: The other players choose a card from their deck and place it face up on the table.
      detail4: The Question Master shuffles the white cards then rereads the question card with each white card. He chooses the best according to his own criteria.
    block2:
      title: How to win
      detail1: The winner of the previous round keeps the question card he won and draws a new one to read it. He becomes the Question Master.
      detail2: The first player who has 5 (or 10 or 20 for the craziest) blue cards wins the game.
